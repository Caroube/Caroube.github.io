## Carob for health care

The carob seeds were used by the Romans as a unit of measure, then by the pharmaceutical industry as a substitute for chocolate ... What about their slimming power?

### What is it

The carob tree spreads 6 to 10 meters high, its trunk thick all over the Mediterranean. Its fruit, carob, has the appearance of a brown pod that contains 12 to 16 seeds. The seeds are used to make locust bean gum, which contains a galactomannan.


### How it works

Carob gum is a thickener; to nearly 90%, it is not digestible. By swelling it acts as a mechanical appetite suppressant.


### Scientific and clinical bases

The thickening effect of carob gum has been very seriously studied in animals. In contrast, little or no clinical study on weight loss in humans.

### Usual doses

Extracts: 500 mg to 1000 mg per day before meals.


### Precautions for use

Do not consume during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
